# pianissimo
A small macropad designed for Osu!Mania, but can be used for basically anything.
(I don't actually play Osu at all, I just thought it would be a fun challenge.)
This is the first thing that I've ever made a PCB or CAD for, so it's probably pretty bad.
It's kind of fun though.
## Mappings
Currently, there's no way to change mappings other than editing `main.py`. Sorry :/

As of Feb 13, though:

- `f`
- `g`
- `h`
- `j`

Rotary Encoder: `volume up/down`

Encoder Switch: `volume mute`
